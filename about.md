I'm Riton, a retired  software developer living in PAU, France.

I spend my spare time running, enjoying real ale, and writing code.

I created this website primarily to allow me to release apps with Linux.

Occasionally I may write about running, real ale, and software development.

This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The theme is a tweaked clone of [Contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) by [Niklas Buschmann](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/).
